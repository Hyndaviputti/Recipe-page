## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries for responsive design
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom fonts and font families

### What I learned

Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of:
- Implementing CSS custom properties for consistent styling.
- Structuring responsive layouts with media queries to ensure optimal display on different devices.
- The importance of using semantic elements for better accessibility and maintainable code.

Example code snippet:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
        background-color: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        padding-bottom: 24px;
    }
    .container {
        max-width: var(--container-size-670px);
        background-color: white;
        border-radius: 15px;
        margin-top: 40px;
        padding: 24px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my knowledge of:
- Advanced CSS properties and animations.
- Implementing more JavaScript to add dynamic interactions.
- Enhancing page accessibility for all users.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Excellent for detailed documentation and examples.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helpful for quick references.
